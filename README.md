## About The Project
The project was created to automate processes for FAMILY BUSINESS

### Built With

* Django
* JQuery - Used because it's just a simple app


### Dev Notes
This is mostly basic CRUD app which involves mostly data-entry

The only real unique thing here is how the production works. For a product there is always a main ingredient,
and based off that main ingredient is how the quantity of other ingredients will be used and will automatically be calculated.

This data is stored in the database where the recipe and ingredients of products are constant.
